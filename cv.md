<p>At a minimum, I plan to successfully complete the RS School course. I believe that there are no unsolvable problems, no matter how much time is spent, the result is important. I had experience creating and maintaining a website for 1 year. It is important to become stronger and better, to acquire new skills. The best reward for work is an excellent result of the work done.</p>
